                    Grains are the basis of the Middle Eastern diet, where wheat and rice are considered staple foods. Barley 
                    is also widely used in the region, and maize in addition has become common in some areas. Bread is a universal 
                    food eaten in some form by all classes at nearly every meal.
    
                    In addition to bread, wheat is also used in burghul and couscous. Burghul is cracked wheat made by partially cooking wheat grains 
                    in water, drying them in an oven (or in the sun), and breaking them into pieces. It is typically cooked in water with flavorings, much like rice.
    
                    Burghul is also used in meat pies and as an ingredient in salads (notably in tabbouleh with chopped parsley, tomato, lemon, and oil). 
                    Freekeh is another common grain, made from immature green wheat.
    
                    Many types of rice are produced and consumed in the region. Plain rice is served under grilled meats or in meat and vegetable stews. 
                    More complex rice dishes have layers of meat, vegetables, sauces, nuts, or dried fruits.
