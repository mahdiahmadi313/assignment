                Grains are the basis of the Middle Eastern diet, where wheat and rice are considered staple foods. Barley is also 
                widely used in the region, and maize in addition has become common in some areas. Bread is a universal food eaten in 
                some form by all classes at nearly every meal.

                In addition to bread, wheat is also used in burghul and couscous. Burghul is cracked wheat made by partially cooking
                 wheat grains in water, drying them in an oven (or in the sun), and breaking them into pieces. It is typically cooked 
                 in water with flavorings, much like rice.
                
                Burghul is also used in meat pies and as an ingredient in salads (notably in tabbouleh with chopped parsley, tomato, 
                lemon, and oil). Freekeh is another common grain, made from immature green wheat.
                
                Many types of rice are produced and consumed in the region. Plain rice is served under grilled meats or in meat and 
                vegetable stews. More complex rice dishes have layers of meat, vegetables, sauces, nuts, or dried fruits.</p>
